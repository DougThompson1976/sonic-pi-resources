# Sonic Pi Resources

This repository is an (more or less) structured collection of my experiments, ideas and notes of how I use Sonic Pi. As this it will be under permanent construction. Much of this is borrowed and/or inspired by other people.

[Sonic Pi](http://sonic-pi.net/) is - among others - a live coding environement created by [Sam Aaron](https://github.com/samaaron/). For a thorough introduction to Sonic Pi it is best to download and install the program and work through the inbuild tutorial.

A preliminary outline of issues I have in mind and will gradually complete:

* Control rhythmic and melodic processes in time
  * Several Ways to play a melody
  * Use of `at`
  * Use of `spread`
  * Synchronisation of live_loops
  * Patterns, bars and phrases
  * Sample slicing and reordering
* Manipulate sound
  * Filters
  * Synths
      * `:fm` (frequency modulation)
  * `control` a running synth
  * `control` and samples
* Miscellaneous musical ideas and effects
  * Echo and break
  * Noise to music
    * `:bpf`
    * Percussion with noise
  * `slicer` and rhythm
  * `reverb`
  * Echo and canon
  * Layered samples with different rates
* Music and chance
* Linear flow versus recurring patterns

(I will write in English. This is not my first language. If you find errors and misspellings ignore it or let me know so I can fix that and improve my English.)
